    <div class="texto"> "Isn't, in fact, theoretically pure anterograde amnesia the postmodern condition par excellence? The present - broken, desolated is constantly erasing itself, leaving few traces. Things catch your attention for a while but you do not remember them for very long. But old memories persist, intact... Constantly commemorated... I love 1923..." - Mark Fisher 'Ghosts Of My Life'<br><br>

"Memories Overlooked: A Tribute To The Caretaker", is a collaborative effort of over 90 artists, paying tribute to the visionary works of Leyland Kirby -- in particular his Caretaker project, a long-running ambient affair exploring memory, nostalgia, and more recently, the effects of dementia. In proper fashion, this compilation was diagnosed with having early onset dementia, and is mixed and arranged in accordance with the advancement of the disease. Every passing hour, to quote Mr. Kirby in regards to his 'Everywhere At The End Of Time' series, "will reveal new points of progression, loss and disintegration. Progressively falling further and further towards the abyss of complete memory loss and nothingness." The project began as a compilation for the fans, by the fans - yet upon receiving numerous submissions from artists whose family members had battled with dementia, it seemed to take on a more meaningful purpose.<br><br>

100% of the digital proceeds of this compilation will be donated to the Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org), who for 37 years, have been advancing research to end Alzheimer's and dementia while enhancing care for those living with the disease. The prestigious No Problema Tapes will be releasing an exclusive run of 4x cassette box sets before the end of the year. (stay sharp...)

Tonight, let's all raise a golden drink to Leyland Kirby, aka The Caretaker. We know the score.<br><br>
